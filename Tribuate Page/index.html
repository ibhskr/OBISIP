                    <p>Lata Mangeshkar was born on September 28, 1929, in Indore, British India. She was the eldest

                        Tragedy struck the family when her father passed away when she was just 13 years old, leaving
                        them in financial distress. Lata Mangeshkar took up singing to support her family.</p>

                        Despite initial struggles due to her plain and nasal voice, she worked tirelessly on her singing
                        skills. In the 1940s and 1950s, she gained recognition for her playback singing in films like

                        throughout her career, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.</p>
